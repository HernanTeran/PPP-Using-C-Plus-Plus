1. #include <algorithm> - report failure by returning the end of a sequence
   #include <numeric>
   r = find(b,e,v)    r points to the first occurrence of v in [b:e)
   r = find_if(b,e,p)   r points to the first element x in [b:e) so that p(x) is true
   x=count(b,e,v)   x is the number of occurences of v in [b:e)
   x=count_if(b,e,p)    x is the number of elements in [b:e) so that p(x) is true
   sort(b,e)    sort [b:e) using <
   sort(b,e,p)    sort [b:e) using p
   copy(b,e,b2)
   r=equal_range(b,e,v)   r is the subsequence of the sorted range [b:e) with the value v, a binary search for v
   equal(b,e,b2) compare elements
   x=accumulate(b,e,i)    x is the sum of i(should = 0) and the element of [b:e)
   x=accumulate(b,e,i,op)   same as before but calculated using op #include <functional>
   -op- (can also be a function/function object that performs an operation)
   multiplies<T>()
   divides<T>()
   modulus<T>()
   mins<T>()
   plus<T>()
   
   
2. A function object is an object that can behave like a function. We need an object because objects can store data.

3. Typically, passing a function object leads to significantly smaller and faster code than passing a function.

4. A predicate is a function that returns true or false.

5. Associative arrays, hash tables, red-black trees. Function with key value pairs or just keys (set) that have a relation to eachother

6. A tree is built from nodes.
   For every node its left sub-node has a key that is less than node's key
   the node's key is less than the key of its right sub-node

7. Each node follows the rule outlined in #6

8. Faster performance and optimized for strings being the keys.

9. A set only has keys but has keys and values.

10. A map doesn't allow duplicate keys but a multimap does.

11. find() is a linear search
    binary_search() and equal_range() are binary searches and are useful for containers with >= 10 elements
    first sort container
    look for value x in the middle if val == x then found
    if val < x look to the right
    if x < val look to the right
    if last element not found

12. A lambda expression is a shorthand notation for defining a function object and then immediately creating an object out of it.

13. #include <map> or <unordered_map>
    map<string, int> words;
    
    for (string s; cin >> s; ) ++words[s];
    
    for (const auto& p : words) cout << p.first << ": " << p.second << '\n';
