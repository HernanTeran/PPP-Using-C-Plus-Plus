1. assignment - assigning a new value to an initialized variable by using the assignment operator ( = )

2. cin - character input stream used for retrieving user input. useful for int and double. use cin.get() for char and getline(cin, var) for string

3. concatenation - the joining of strings using the + and += operators

4. conversion - char to int, int to char according to the ASCII table

5. declaration - type and name is provided for an object but no memory is set aside for it because it is uninitialized

6. decrement - --

7. definition - a declaration of type name for an object and initialization of the object with a value

8. increment - ++

9. initialization - providing an initial value for an object. Best if using the list-based notation known as universal and uniform initialization with { }

10. name - an identifier for a statement/object

11. narrowing - a narrowing conversion, produces a loss information by trying to fit a type's size into another that is incompatible

12. object - a region in memory that has a type which dictates what type of information can go in it

13. operation - a computation or expression made to get a result

14. operator - used for operations (+, -, *, /)

15. type - a type defines a set of possible values and a set of operations for an object.

16. type safety - initialization + avoidance of narrowing conversion

17. value - a literal according to type, a set of bits memory interpreted according to a type.

18. variable - a named object

19. object- an object is some memory that holds a value of a given type.
