7. A .h suffix signifies a header file. Header files contain definitions of terms that are used in a program.

8. The linker is a program that links all of the translation units together. source code -> compiler -> object code -> linker <- object code from directives -> exectuable file

9. A source file is a .cpp file that you write your code in and an object file is a .obj file that contains the translated code as machine code. Object code is not portable.

10. An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment that provides the tools to edit, check, and run your program.
