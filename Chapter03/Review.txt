1. What is meant by the term prompt?

2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable?

3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it
   and to input the value into your program?
   
4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve?

5. What terminates input into a string?

6. What terminates input into an integer?

7. How would you write:
   cout << "Hello, ";

14. What is the difference between = and ==?

15. What is a definition?

16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?

19. What is type safety and why is it important?

20. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?

21. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.

1. A prompt is issued to the user using cout and it is meant to get the user's input

2. >> the extraction operator

3. cout << (prompt), cin >> variable;

4. \n means newline and it creates a newline

5. strings are terminated by whitespace 

6. integer input is terminated by non-integer input such as hitting the enter key

7. std::cout << "Hello, << first_name << "!\n";

8. An object is a region in memory with a type that specifies what information can be placed in it

9. A literal is the literal value of an object based on type

10. int, double, string, char

11. a variable is a named object

12. char(1), int(4), double (8), bool(1), string(depends on number of characters in it +1 for whitespace '\0')

13. Bits and bytes are used to measure size. There are 8 bits in 1 byte.

14. = is the assignment operator and == is the equals operator

15. A definition is a statement that introduces a new name into a program and sets aside memory for a variable through initialization

16. Initialization is giving an object an initial value once it is defined (Use { }). Assignment is giving an object a new value after initialization (Use =)

17. String concatenation is the joining of two strings by using the + and += operators

18. The first character should be a letter, must contain alphabetical characters, or digits, or an underscore, and no other characters

19. Type safety is initialization of objects and avoiding the conversion of data types. It is important because it prevents errors

20. A conversion from double to int is called a narrowing conversion because double has 8 bytes and an int has 4 bytes the sizes conflict

21. char & int conversion is safe as long as it is based off of the ASCII table. int to double is safe as long as its whole numbers like 2 -> 2.0
