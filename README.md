# Programming: Principles and Practices Using C++

## 1/21/2021
This repository contains the drills, reviews, terms, and exercises of most chapters.
I am not going to focus on chapters 12, 13, 15, or 16 because the FLTK installation process is tedious. 
Therefore, I will compensate with a repository of exercises from Starting Out With C++ by Tony Gaddis.
